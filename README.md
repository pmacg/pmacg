- 👋 Hi, I’m Peter Macgregor, a PhD candidate in computer science at the University of Edinburgh.
- 👀 My research interests are in graph clustering, particularly in bringing together theory and practice.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning julia since it is popular in the network science community, and makes some bold promises!
- 💞️ I have some public repositories with various bits and bobs I've developed to help with writing graph algorithms.
- 📫 I try to document everything reasonably well, but if anything isn't clear or you'd just like to connect, then you can reach me at <firstname>.<lastname> <at> ed.ac.uk.
