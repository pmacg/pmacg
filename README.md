I’m a Lecturer in the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews. My research interests are broadly in algorithms for data science and machine learning and I always aim to develop theoretically sound algorithms which work well in practice. Please see [my website](http://pmacg.io) for more information on my work.

If you'd like help with any of my work, or you'd just like to connect, then please do get in touch using the contact details on my website.
