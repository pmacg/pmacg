I’m Peter Macgregor, a Research Associate in Algorithms and Complexity at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests are in unsupervised learning, graph clustering, and algorithmic spectral graph theory. Please see [my website](https://pmacg.github.io) for more information on my work.

I am currently working on building the [STAG library](https://github.com/stagorg/stag), which is a new C++ and python library providing efficient spectral algorithms for analysing massive graphs.

If you'd like help with any of my repositories, or you'd just like to connect, then you can reach me at [peter.macgregor@ed.ac.uk](mailto:peter.macgregor@ed.ac.uk).
